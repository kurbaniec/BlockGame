Building the game using Visual Studio with CMake and the MSVC toolchain under Windows:

`File > Open > CMake`

![](.img/build_1.png)

Select `CMakeCache.txt`

![](.img/build_2.png)

Select the correct target `Block_Game.exe`

## :package: Dependencies 

* `FreeGLUT`

  OpenGL Utility Toolkit library for window management & more.

* `irrKlang`

  Free sound library for non-commercial use.

All dependencies (suitable for use under Windows) are found in the `dependencies` folder. One does not need to configure system paths or anything else in order to use them, CMake does all the heavy lifting for you.

## :thinking: Problems while Building

* `cmake_minimum_required`

  Check if your running the latest CMake version. You can also specify it explicitly under `Manage Configuration > Advanced > CMake executable`. A typical path is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\BuildTools\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin`.
